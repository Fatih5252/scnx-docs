# Level Up Your Discord: Introducing SCNX Linked Roles

In any active Discord server, clarity is key. How can members instantly recognize staff in a busy chat? SCNX is thrilled
to introduce [**Linked Roles**](/docs/linked-roles/intro/), a powerful feature that displays a user's most important
role—like "Admin" or "Moderator"
—as an official tag right next to their username in every message. This is more than a cosmetic update; it's a
fundamental upgrade that brings immediate authority, trust, and professionalism to your community's conversations.

## The Strategic Advantage of Linked Roles {#strategic-advantages}

Linked Roles transform a simple permission set into a dynamic tool for community management.

* **Instant Authority and Trust:** A visible tag like "Moderator" immediately gives weight to a user's message, making
  moderation and official announcements more effective without members needing to check a profile.
* **A Polished, Organized Look:** Clearly identified staff and key members make a server feel more curated and
  professional, helping to attract and retain users who value structure.
* **Enhanced Member Recognition:** Use Linked Roles to publicly reward valuable members with tags like "VIP"
  or "Contributor", creating a powerful incentive for others to engage more deeply with the community.

## The SCNX Advantage: Powerfully Simple {#scnx-features}

SCNX has engineered Linked Roles to be flexible and user-friendly, removing the technical barriers typically associated
with this feature.

* **No-Code Setup:** While setting up linked roles can be complex through Discord's developer tools, SCNX provides an
  intuitive dashboard that guides you through the process in minutes, no coding required.
* **Deep Customization:** [Tailor the user authorization page](/docs/linked-roles/settings/#authorization-page) with
  over 30 themes and custom branding to match your
  server's aesthetic. The page also supports multiple languages automatically. For a fully integrated feel, the
  [Professional Plan](/docs/scnx/guilds/plans/) allows for the removal of SCNX branding.
* **Flexible Management:** Easily [assign or remove roles from the SCNX dashboard](/docs/linked-roles/user-management/). A
  unique ["Public Role"](/docs/linked-roles/role-management/#public-roles) option allows
  any server member to claim a specific role, streamlining onboarding for roles like "Verified Member".
* **Dedicated Support:** Get expert help with any questions on the [official SCNX Discord server](https://scnx.app),
  with support available
  in English and German.

## A Quick Guide to Implementation {#setup}

The SCNX dashboard makes the setup process straightforward.

### Prerequisites {#requirements}

* Your server must be on a paid SCNX plan ([Unlimited](/docs/scnx/guilds/plans/)
  or [Professional](/docs/scnx/guilds/plans/)) or have an active free trial.
* You are the owner, a [trusted admin with the Co-Owner permission](/docs/scnx/guilds/trusted-admins) or an
  administrator of the server you want to enable this feature.
* Set aside 5-10 minutes to complete the process.

### Setup Overview {#setup}

1. **Connect SCNX and Discord:** The SCNX dashboard will guide you through creating a Discord Application and securely
   linking it to the SCNX platform.
2. **Create and Link Your Role:**
   First, [create the Linked Role in your SCNX dashboard](/docs/linked-roles/role-management/#create-linked-scnx-role).
   Then, create a corresponding
   standard role in your Discord server's settings. In that role's "Links" tab, [add a requirement and select your
   application](/docs/linked-roles/role-management/#linked-role-on-discord) and the role you just created.
3. **Ensure Visibility:** For the role tag to appear in chat, you must go into the Channel Settings [for every relevant
   channel, add the new role, and grant it the "View Channel" permission](/docs/linked-roles/role-management/#display-in-chat).

## The Seamless Member Experience {#easy-setup}

Claiming a role [is simple for your members](/docs/linked-roles/claim-roles/). They just click the server name, select "Linked Roles," and choose the role
they wish to claim. This directs them to the custom authorization page. After a one-time approval, they can claim any
future roles without repeating the process. Members can also easily remove the role tag themselves from their server
profile.
