Hey there,

The holidays are just around the corner! Easter is coming up, so it's time to prepare an event for your Discord – and it's super easy with SCNX!

## Easter is Just Around the Corner

Easter is just around the corner, and what could be better than going on an Easter egg hunt together – even if it's digital this year.
An egg-collecting event on your Discord server brings your community together in a playful way. Hide virtual eggs in different channels and have your members solve tricky puzzles or master small tasks to find them. This way, you'll ensure lots of fun and strengthen the sense of community, no matter where your members are currently located.

## Virtual Egg Hunt with SCNX\!

Are you looking for an exciting and interactive way to delight your Discord community this Easter? Then we have the perfect tip for you: host a virtual Easter egg code hunt with the "Collect the Codes" module from **SCNX**!

As the [article on scnx.tips](https://scnx.tips/hunt-the-code/) by our helper Hörnchen explains, this module offers a playful way to hide codes on your server that your members can find and redeem. Whoever collects the most codes will be displayed in a leaderboard – a great incentive for your community!

## How it Works

:::tip Not with SCNX yet?
SCNX is a service where you can create a completely customizable Discord bot for your server without any programming. You can follow [these easy instructions](/docs/setup) to get started right away.
:::

* **Hide Codes:** Use the diverse suggestions from the article and place virtual "Easter eggs" in the form of text codes or even thematically appropriate emojis in creative locations on your server. These can be channel names, descriptions, user bios, hidden messages (using ||), custom commands, or even emoji and role names.
* **Members Search and Redeem:** Your community members use simple commands like `/hunt-the-code profile` to see their progress and `/hunt-the-code redeem` to redeem found codes.
* **Competition and Fun:** A live leaderboard (`/hunt-the-code leaderboard`) creates an exciting competition.
* **Admin Tools:** Admins retain control with commands like `/hunt-the-code-admin end` (to end and reset) and `/hunt-the-code-admin report` (for a detailed overview of the findings).

You can find more information in the [scnx.tips article](https://scnx.tips/hunt-the-code/).

## Why is this a Good Idea for Your Easter Event?

* **Community Activation:** It promotes interaction and engagement among your members.
* **Playful Fun:** The hunt for codes is an entertaining experience for everyone.
* **Flexibility:** You can adapt the difficulty and the type of codes to your community.
* **Easy Implementation:** The SCNX module makes organization straightforward.
* **Digital Alternative:** Perfect for spreading Easter joy in the virtual world as well.

## Tips for a Successful Event

* Provide hints in the announcement about where the codes might be hidden.
* Regularly publish interim standings of the leaderboard.
* Consider small digital prizes or special roles for the most successful collectors.
