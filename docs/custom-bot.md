## 0. Pre-Flight-Checklist ðŸ›« {#step-0}

Before you can create your Custom-Bot on SCNX, please make sure that

* you have [added your Server to SCNX](./setup).
* you are the owner of the server you want to enable this feature
  on ([why?](./scnx/guilds/trusted-admins#throubleshooting)) - if you are not the owner, please ask them to enable this
  feature for you and grant you access as a [Trusted Admin](./scnx/guilds/trusted-admins).
* a few minutes time (our estimate is that this takes around two minutes to finish on a computer, on mobile it may take
  a bit longer) to finish this guide - don't stop in the middle; your progress won't be saved.

## 1. Create your Discord-Application & -Bot ðŸ¤– {#step-1}

:::caution
Do **not reuse** an existing application. You'll need a new application for your Custom-Bot. SCNX does not support
running Modmail and Custom-Bot any another, third-party Bot (like txadmin) with the same token / application - please
create a new one for each bot.
:::

First, visit the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications). There, create a new
application by clicking on "New Application" on the upper-left side of your Developer Portal. A modal will open. Enter
the name of the application (you can change this later), read & accept
the [Discord Developer Terms of Service](https://discord.com/developers/docs/policies-and-agreements/terms-of-service)
and the [Discord Developer Policy](https://discord.com/developers/docs/policies-and-agreements/developer-policy) (these
policies also apply to your use of the Discord API as part of SCNX) and create your bot by confirming with "Create".

Next, open the "Bot"-Settings in the navigation bar on the right-hand screen.
There, you can configure the icon and username - you don't need to,
as you can also [do this directly on SCNX](./scnx/guilds/bots#change-profile).

What you need to do next is enabling all the so-called "Intents" of your bot. These allow your bot to access certain
data on
your server. This is required for certain features to work. Additionally, we suggest disabling the "Public bot"-Setting,
as your Custom-Bot will only work on your server. Take extra care to not enable the "Requires Oauth2 Code Grant"
functionality.

You are almost done in the Discord Developer Dashboard - the last step is to generate a token and copy it. To do so,
scroll up and click on "Reset token" (still on the Bot page) and confirm your request in the modal. You might get access
to enter a 2FA-Code for your Discord-Account.

Once done, please **copy the token of your bot**. You'll need it in the next step.

:::danger
**Only** paste your token in the Dashboard. **Never** send a token to another user, trusted-admins or a member
of our staff. Treat tokens like a password - users with access to your token are able to use your bot to perform
harmful actions.
:::

## 2. Create your Bot on SCNX ðŸš€ {#step-2}

Open the [SCNX Dashboard](https://scnx.app/user/guilds/) and select the server you want to create the bot for. Next,
select "Discord-Bot" in the sidebar.

![](@site/docs/assets/setup/custom-bot-4.png)

You'll find a video showing how you should create the Discord-Bot. If you've followed this guide, you can confidently
skip this using the "I have created a bot"-button. Next, you'll be asked to enter the token you obtained
in [step 1](#step-1). Do this and click on "Check my token". SCNX will now verify your token. Once SCNX finished
processing, please invite your Bot to your server using the button labeld "Invite Bot" - if you missed this step, don't
worry; you can also [invite the bot](./scnx/guilds/bots#invite-bot) later. Don't close this tab yet - you'll need to
click on "Create bot" to finish the process.

![](@site/docs/assets/setup/custom-bot-5.png)

To invite your bot, you only need to click on the "Invite Bot"-Button. This will open Discord's Oauth2 Grant Screen
(that's how nerds call the screen below ðŸ¤“). SCNX already selected your server for you. Simply click "Continue" and
"Authorize" to finish the process. If you want, you can remove the "Administrator" permission, but this will make it
more
difficult to use the bot down the line, as SCNX is not yet able (the nerds are still working on this ðŸ¤“) to show
which feature needs what permissions and handle permission-related error correctly.

Last, but not least, you'll need to confirm that you want to create your bot in the SCNX Dashboard - simply click on "
Create bot".

## 3. Celebrate your new Bot ðŸŽ‰ {#done}

If you did everything right, your bot should now be online on Discord. Pat yourself on the back. You did a great job and
are now ready to explore the universe of a highly-customizable Discord-Bot for your community - not just a Discord-Bot,
*your* Discord-Bot[.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1014523525467471882/1147206627657789591/7xpodw.jpg)

Here are a few things you can do now:

* enable a few of the many Custom-Bot-Modules.
* use Bot-Log-In to create messages with Self-Roles and more.
* create Custom-Commands to do fun things.
* configure the behavior of your bot.
* and much more, open the [Custom-Bot Documentation](./custom-bot/intro) to view every option.
