# About SCNX Linked Roles

:::warning This feature is Early Access
Linked roles are Early Access. This means that in addition to a paid plan,
a [membership](https://membership.scootkit.com) with Early Access is also required. Early Access helps us invest money & time in developing new features and products. We plan to make this feature available to everyone with Unlimited / Professional plan without memberships in late Q2 2025.

Linked-Roles allow you, to display the role of a user next to their name on your Discord server. To do this, the user
needs to authorize with your Discord Bot and claim their role manually. Displaying the role next to the username makes
your Discord appear professionally and increases the user experience on your Discord server; your users can see at a
glance that they are talking to a staff member, to a moderator or to an admin.

Here's how Linked-Roles could look on your server:

SCNX makes it easy to set up and manage Linked Roles on your very own Discord - there's no coding required and setup can
be done in a few easy steps in our easy-to-use dashboard.

To use Linked Roles, you need [add your server to SCNX](./../setup) and to have a [paid plan](../scnx/guilds/plans) that
includes access to this feature - you can also try a paid plan for free if you are eligible.
