## Requirements {#requirements}

Before you can claim your Linked Role, an administrator needs to
have [created the Linked-Role on SCNX](./role-managment#create-linked-scnx-role), [configure it on Discord](./role-managment#linked-role-on-discord)
and then [assign the role](./user-managment#add-role) to you. If these steps aren't finished, you won't be able to claim
your role.

If you run into issues when following this guide, please contact your server administrator and link them to
our [troubleshooting page](./troubleshooting), where we go into detail on how to fix issues.
