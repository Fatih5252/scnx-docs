# Migration guide (Q4, 2024)

Hi, thanks for using SCNX. We're happy to announce some changes that will improve our services. In this document, we're
explaining what steps you need to take to continue using SCNX,
what's changed, and we'll also answer frequently asked questions about the migration.

## Overview {#overview}

### What's changing {#changes}

The following changes will affect your usage of SCNX:

* [The legal operator of SCNX has changed](#legal-entity)
* [New pricing will apply](#new-pricing)
* And some other [minor changes](#other-changes)
* And some [plans for the future](#future)

### What you need to do

To avoid issues with your account, please

1. Visit [scnx.app/user/tos-update](https://scnx.app/user/tos-update) and agree to the new [legal entity](#legal-entity)
   that will be your contractual partner regarding your usage of SCNX.
2. If you have any subscriptions and want to keep your current subscription
   price, [migrate your subscriptions](#migrate-subscriptions) by
   visiting [scnx.app/user/tos-update](https://scnx.app/user/tos-update) before the migration period ends.

## New legal operator & new Terms of Service {#legal-entity}

Before the migration date, SCNX was run by an individual. After the migration, SCNX will be run by a registered company.
This allows us to growth easier, protect our employees and provide a better service to our customers. You can find the
company details of the new entity [here](https://scootkit.com/imprint).

We can't automatically transfer your account to the new legal entity due legal restrictions. This is the reason why when
you log in to SCNX with an existing user account, you'll see an "Agree to our new Terms of Service" banner on your page.
Please click on the button in the banner or follow [this link](https://scnx.app/user/tos-update) to first agree to
transfer your data to the new operator and then agree to our terms of service. Once done, you will be asked
to [migrate your subscriptions](#migrate-subscriptions), if you had any.

The new legal entity is fully owned by SCNX's founder (Simon, @scderox) and has no outside investors - this way, we can
continue focusing on creating the best service possible, without any pressure to be profitable.

<details>
<summary>What happens if I don't agree within the migration period?</summary>

Failure to accept the new terms will first lead to a deactivated SCNX account. After a grace period, we'll start
deleting deactivated accounts in accordance with European privacy laws.
</details>

<details>
<summary>I don't want to accept the new Terms and operator</summary>

You can inform us via E-Mail to [legal@scootkit.com](mailto:scootkit.com) or by sending a certified letter to
our [address](https://scootkit.com/imprint). If you do so, we'll cancel your contract and delete your account.
</details>

## New pricing {#new-pricing}

To make sure we can continue offering SCNX, we've adjusted the pricing of our service to keep up with new market
realities. This was required, as we need to start collecting sales tax and to keep up with increasing costs of hosting
and infrastructure.

We're introducing two new plans: Unlimited and Professional. You can find all details about these
plans [on our pricing docs page](./guilds/plans). Old plans are considered legacy and can't be purchased anymore.

If you want to hear our reasoning for the new prices and want to hear how we decided on
them, [watch this German recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di_TeQt_rQ8) of our membership
meeting - [ScootKit members](https://membership.scootkit.com) receive regular Behind-The-Scenes updates, get access to
Early Access features and are able to participate in discussions about new features and changes (like this pricing
change).

Additionally, we've added Server-Bundles: You can now add additional servers for a lower price - this means that if
you have multiple servers on SCNX, premium plans will be significantly less
expensive. [Learn more](./guilds/plans#additional-servers) about this.

### Effect on existing servers {#effect-on-servers}

The following table explains which type of upgrade is affected in what way:

| Upgrade-Type                              | Changes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 
|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Starter-Plan                              | The Starter plan is free for ever and is not affected in any way.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| One-Time Upgrades                         | If you have upgraded your server using a one-time upgrade, this upgrade won't be removed until it expires. Your old plan can't be renewed.                                                                                                                                                  |
| Subscriptions                             | Unless you [migrate your subscriptions](#migrate-subscription) in the migration period, your subscription will be canceled and your plan will be downgraded at the end of your billing period. [Migrate your subscription](#migrate-subscriptions) to keep your old price until you cancel. |
| [Lifetime-Plans](./guilds/plans#lifetime) | Lifetime plans will continue to work and they'll continue to unlock all features for your plan. You can always transfer your plan. If you want to upgrade to one of the new plans, you'll need to contact our team, as upgrade pricing depends on your usage of your lifetime plan.         |

### Migrate subscriptions {#migrate-subscriptions}

:::success We value our subscribers!
We think simply changing prices for subscriptions is uncool. So we offer a limited time offer for existing subscribers:
Migrate your subscription before it expires to keep your current price - until you cancel.
:::

Please consider the following restrictions:

* Only customers in the EU eligible. Only previous active subscriptions with euro as currency eligible.
* If you had multiple subscriptions, these subscriptions will be combined into one subscription. The full price of all
  previous subscriptions will be charged once per billing period. The subscription can only be canceled together. It
  might be more economical to consider switching to our new pricing structure, which
  allows [server bundles](./guilds/plans).
* Migration must be completed before your billing period ends and before the migration period expires.
* Your payment method needs to be re-entered. If you pay using reoccurring bank transfer, please also make sure to
  update our bank details with your bank.
* Failure to pay your new subscription on time, declining payments or other issues with your payment method will lead to
  your subscription being canceled.
* You can cancel at any time. In case of any cancellation, your subscription can't be renewed and it will expire once
  your billing period ends. Your access to this offer ends at that time.

To migrate your subscription, please visit [scnx.app/user/tos-update](https://scnx.app/user/tos-update) and follow the
instructions there.

## Other changes {#other-changes}

The following other changes were also conducted:

* **Customers outside the EU**: Customers outside the EU can now use our service in accordance with our
  updated [Terms of Service](https://scootk.it/scnx-tos). Please note that ScootKit won't accept payments from customers
  outside the EU for now, we're working with a partner to accept global payments and will provide an update soon.
* **Referrals**: For now, we've paused our referral program until further notice. We're reworking our affiliate system
  and will provide an update soon.
* **VAT**: ScootKit UG (haftungsbeschr√§nkt) will now charge VAT in accordance with German and European regulation.
  You'll see VAT on your invoice.
* **Credits**: SCNX credits have been converted into account balance that will be automatically applied when purchasing
  any products, excluding reoccurring payments, on our plattform. Account balance cannot be topped up.
* **Payment methods**: For EU customers, we've added Revolut Pay as a payment method. For now, payments with paysafecard
  are temporarily unavailable.
* **SCN Memberships**: We are currently reworking our membership program. It will be called "ScootKit membership" and
  will be available in German and English. We'll provide additional details soon. Pricing is not expected to change
  significantly.
* **AI Credits**: We've improved the packages you can purchase AI credits in. They are now more streamlined and more
  accurately reflect our customers needs.
* **Marketplace**: Payouts can now only be made by submitting a valid VAT E-Invoice to ScootKit. We're working on a better solution.
* We've also fixed a bunch of bugs and have added a lot of other small features to improve your customer experience.

## Plans for the future {#plans}

With these changes out of the way, we can guarantee stability: No price increases are planned for the next few years -
instead, we're working on countless new ideas, projects, features and improvements. Among them, a completely overhauled
Ticket-System, improved modmail management system for your customer service representatives and more - all included in
the new plans.

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to [contact our team](https://scnx.app/help), we're happy to help.
