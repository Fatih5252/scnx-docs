## Upgrade your plan {#upgrade}

To upgrade your SCNX Server plan, please visit
the [pricing page](https://scnx.app/glink?page=pricing?showUpgradeModal=true) of your server and open the upgrade modal.
Here, select the Payment-Terms (available options: "One-Time", "Monthly", "Yearly", ["Lifetime"](#lifetime)) and your
currency. If
you want to pay using [SCNX Credits](./../account-and-billing/faq#scnx-credits), please indicate this now.

![](@site/docs/assets/scnx/guilds/plans/subscription-setup.png)

Your next steps will be different, depending on what Payment terms you've selected. Please follow the instructions in
the dashboard and return to this page if you have any questions or concerns â€” we'll do our best to cover them in
our [Frequently asked questions](#faq) section.

## Lifetime-Plans {#lifetime}

Lifetime plans

* are not bound to servers, instead to users - they can be [transferred](#lifetime-apply) every 7 days (this is
  optional).
* will include features of the respective plan as long as SCNX exists (
  see [SCNX Terms of Service](https://faq.scnx.app/scnx-nutzungsbedingungen/#pl%C3%A4ne)) - even if we change the name
  of plans or package content.
* are offered for a limited-time-only to allow us to expand - they will be removed in the future.
* ensure that you will not get charged again, even if we increase the prices of plans.
* allow us to keep improving this service :heart:

### Purchase a Lifetime-Plan {#lifetime-purchase}

To purchase a Lifetime-Plan open your [Liftime-Plan Panel](https://scnx.app/user/lifetime-plans) and select the plan you
want to purchase. Next, finish the purchase using your favorite payment method - you'll be able to select the server you
want to use the plan on later.

Once you have finished your purchase, return to the [Liftime-Plan Panel](https://scnx.app/user/lifetime-plans) and
follow the [instructions to apply a Lifetime-Plan](#lifetime-apply).

You can own as many Lifetime-Plans as you want - each of which you can transfer between servers, if you want to.

### Apply or transfer a Lifetime-Plan to a server {#lifetime-apply}

:::info
You can apply a Lifetime-Plan on any server you have access to. A Lifetime-Plan can be transferred between servers every
7 days.
:::

After purchasing a Lifetime-Plan needs to be applied to a server. This means that the server will be upgraded to the
plan of your lifetime-plan and will have this plan until you remove the lifetime-plan from this server. The same process
can be used to transfer a Lifetime-Plan from one server to another.

To apply or transfer a Lifetime-Plan, visit the [Liftime-Plan Panel](https://scnx.app/user/lifetime-plans) in your
dashboard. There, click on "Manage Lifetime-Plan" next to the Lifetime-Plan you want to manage. A modal will appear
containing details about your Lifetime-Plan. Click on "Transfer Lifetime-Plan to another server" and select the server
you want to transfer the plan to. SCNX will run a few checks to make sure the server you want to transfer the plan to is
ready - once that's done, confirm your request. If you see a warning or error, please refer to the table below for
details.

<details>
<summary>A warning or error is being shown when I want to transfer my Lifetime-Plan</summary>
<table>
<tr><td>Error</td><td>Reason</td><td>Solution</td></tr>
<tr><td>This guild is already using a Lifetime-Plan.</td><td>Another (or this) Lifetime-Plan is already applied to this guild.</td><td><ul><li>Remove the Lifetime-Plan from this guild.</li><li><a href="https://scnx.app/help">Contact our staff</a> for advice.</li></ul></td></tr>
<tr><td>This guild as an active subscription.</td><td>This guild is currently subscribed to a subscription. Lifetime-Plans can not be applied to servers with an active subscription.</td><td>
<ul><li>Cancel the subscription and wait until it expires.</li><li><a href="https://scnx.app/help">Contact our staff</a> to remove it immediately.</li></ul></td></tr>
<tr><td>This guild has [a plan]. Continuing will overwrite this plan.</td><td>This means that the server still has some time left in its current plan. Continuing will remove this time, and we can not restore it.</td><td>You can continue by acknowledging that the server will lose its current Plan-Time (the Lifetime-Plan will still be applied). Alternatively, you can wait until the current plan has expired.</td></tr>
<tr><td>This guild has [a plan]. You can not continue as this action would overwrite the plan of this guild, and you are not the owner.</td><td>Only the server owner can apply their own Lifetime-Plan if such application leads to Plan-Time loss.</td><td><ul><li>Contact the Server-Owner that you want to apply a Lifetime-Plan and that they should no longer extend the Plan-Time of their server. Wait until the current Server-Plan expires.</li><li><a href="https://scnx.app/help">Contact our staff</a> for advice.</li></ul></td></tr>
<tr><td>This Lifetime-Plan needs to cool down</td><td>Lifetime-Plans can only be transferred every 7 days between servers. This Lifetime-Plan has been transferred in the last 7 days.</td><td>Wait until the cooldown-period expires.</td></tr>

## Ad-Supported Starter Plan {#starter-plan}

Every server without a paid plan is required to periodically watch a so-called Checkin-Video-Ad; otherwise their bot
will temporarily
stop after their free plan ends, until they watch another ad. These are short 15-60s videos from advertisers. The
advertiser you watch this advertisement from is then paying for your hosting costs. These Checkins need to happen every
14 days. You can also extend this time to 28 days by watching two Checkin-Ads at a time. You can watch these video ads
on
your server's [pricing page](https://scnx.app/glink?page=pricing).

Please remember: There are no (and there never will be) third-party-ads in your Custom- or Modmail-Bots. The bots
themselves are free of ads. You only need to watch an advertisement in your SCNX-Dashboard every 14 days to keep your
bot
running.

You can watch up to two ads at a time which sumps up to 28 days of hosting time. You can not have more than 28 days of
hosting time at a time. You can also ask your [Trusted Admins](./trusted-admins) to watch videos for your server.

If you forget to extend your hosting time, your bots will shut down, and you won't be able to start them again without
extending your hosting time. No data will be deleted in such a case. You can set up a notification 24 hours before your Hosting-Time ends in your
server's [pricing page](https://scnx.app/glink?page=pricing) under "Manage Free-Plan" -> "Manage notifications" to
prevent this from happening in the future.

<details>
<summary>I already have a subscription or Plan and want to switch to a Lifetime-Plan. Can my existing plan be prorated?</summary>

If your plan or subscription has more than two months left, we might be able to prorate your Lifetime-Purchase or issue a prorated refund. Please <a href="https://scnx.app/help">contact our staff</a>.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I transfer my plan and remaining Plan time or subscriptions to another server?</summary>

Our team can manually transfer your plan and associated data (like remaining Plan time and subscriptions) if <b>one</b> of the following conditions is being met:
<ul>
<li>Your plan is being paid by an active subscription</li>
<li>Your remaining Plan time is more than a month</li>
</ul>
<b>You can only request a Plan transfer once every 6 months</b>. <br/>
To start such a transfer, please <a href="https://scnx.app/help">contact our staff</a>. Please note that we might deny your request if we believe you abuse this policy. It also makes sense to reach out if you do not meet these requirements, as our staff can make exceptions on a case-to-case-basis.
If you plan to <a href="./faq#transfer">request a complete data transfer</a> to another server (this includes configuration data of bots and more), please do not request a plan-transfer as this makes a complete data transfer impossible.

Please note: Transferring your plan will <b>overwrite</b> an existing Plan date. Plan times from both servers will not be summed up.
