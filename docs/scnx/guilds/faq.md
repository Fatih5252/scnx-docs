# Frequently asked questions

Frequently asked questions about how servers work on SCNX.

## Why do I need to be the owner to add a server to SCNX? {#owner}

Only the owner can sign up a new Discord-Server to SCNX. The reason for this is legal and based on
our [Terms of Service](https://sc-net.work/scnx-tos) - we might change this in the future. For now, you can simply ask
the owner to [set up SCNX](/docs/setup) on their server and ask them to give
you [trusted admin permissions](/docs/scnx/guilds/trusted-admins).

## Can I create multiple Discord-Bots for a server? {#multiple-bots}

Sort of - you can create one [Custom Bot](/docs/custom-bot/intro) and one [Modmail Bot](/docs/modmail/intro) per
server. But you can not split features of the Custom-Bot into multiple bots (for example one bot for just
Temp-Channels). While you can add your bot to other servers, they won't work on them.
The reason for it is that hosting more bots would be very expensive for us, but the even bigger reason is the very
design of SCNX:
We designed our system to replace often multiple generic bots on a server by one, custom bot.

## Can I remove the SCNX Management Bot? {#scnx-manager-bot}

Yes. Simply kick the bot from your server. Servers without the SCNX-Bot can't use SCNX-Bot features,
like [backups](/docs/scnx/guilds/backups) or [analytics](/docs/scnx/guilds/analytics). All hosting features, including all features of your bots, are
unaffected.

## What counts as commercial usage? {#commercial-usage}

To use SCNX in any commercial manner or situation, you'll need to purchase the [SCNX PRO Plan](https://scnx.xyz/plans).
Please read this [FAQ-Article](https://faq.scnx.app/commercial-usage-of-scnx/) to learn more about, appeal or report
commercial usage on SCNX.

## My server got banned / deactivated / flagged on SCNX - what can I do now? {#banned}

Oh no - please follow the instructions on your dashboard. If you need help,
please [reach out to our staff](https://scnx.app/help).

## Can I transfer all my SCNX Data from one server to another? {#transfer}

You can request a "complete data transfer" if both of your servers are currently active on SCNX
(please add the new server before creating a request), and you are the owner of both servers.

As this process involves manual labor from our site, you will be charged 4,99 â‚¬ (including VAT) for a transfer.

:::danger
ALL data will be completely transferred to your new server. This will overwrite existing settings for your new server.
:::

To request a complete data transfer, please [contact our team](https://scnx.app/help).

## How can I remove my server from SCNX? {#deletion}

We're sorry that you want to leave SCNX - if you are only experiencing an issue with SCNX, we
are [happy to help](https://scnx.app/help) on our [Discord](https://sc-net.work/dc).

:::danger
Deleting a server on SCNX is irreversible. You need to be the owner to delete a server from SCNX. If you have an active
plan, subscription or purchase for the server you delete, this will be lost.
:::
If you want to delete your server permanently from SCNX, visit
the [server settings](https://scnx.app/glink?page=settings). Scroll down to the "Legal" section and click on "Delete
guild from SCNX". You'll be asked to select a reason (you won't need to elaborate) for deletion. Next, you'll receive a
DM to confirm your deletion request. Click the button below the DM to confirm your request, and your server will be
removed from SCNX - you'll receive confirmation once that's done via DMs - that usually takes about 1-5 minutes.
