To use SCNX, you'll need to authorized certain access to your Discord account. Our access is strictly limited, but we
understand that you might be worried about sharing personal data with a third party. Here's an explanation about why we
require which scope.

| Scope                                    | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                          |

| Access your username, avatar, and banner | We require this information to identify you and to run the dashboard - we'll (for example) show your profile-picture in the dashboard                                                |                                                                                                                                                         |
| Access to E-Mail-Address                 | This is required to send you invoices & legal information (like policy changes). We are not a certain big bot with a blue profile picture and will never send you marketing E-Mails. |
| Know what servers you're in              | In the dashboard we display all servers you have access to. For this to work, we need to know what servers you are currently in.                                                     |                                                                                                                                                                                     |
