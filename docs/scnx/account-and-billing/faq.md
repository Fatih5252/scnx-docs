# Frequently asked questions

## Billing related {#billing}

### How do I manage my subscription? {#manage-subscription}

To manage your subscription, visit your [payment page](https://scnx.app/user/payments) on your dashboard. There, you'll
be able to review and cancel any running subscriptions.

### I am VAT exempt {#vat}

We are currently not participating in the VAT-Reverse-Charge-System, but do not need to charge VAT for anyone,
regardless of their VAT status.

### How do I set my billing address? {#billing-details}

To set your billing address, please visit the [payment page](https://scnx.app/user/payments) on your dashboard. There,
you'll find a Invoice-Data section. You can enter your invoice details there. If you need an invoice re-generated,
please contact [our staff](https://scnx.app/help).
Please note: Depending on your entries, we might ask you to verify the details (as required by law in certain
scenarios). If we find that you have abuse this (e.g. entered invalid addresses), we may disable this feature for your
account (or take other actions, if necessary).

### Why can't I pay with SEPA Direct Debit? {#direct-debit}

Please read this [FAQ Article](https://faq.scnx.app/sepa-lastschrift/) to review information about SEPA Direct Debit
payments.

### How does SCNX know that I wired a bill? {#wire-transfer}

When paying with wire transfer, you'll be assigned a custom IBAN on a virtual bank account. Every payment that arrives
at that account will be credited towards your bills - the transaction reference is not required (but recommended for
one-time purchases), as we can easily assign a payment to your account based on the IBAN the money was recived on.

### My card was declined, but all my data is valid {#no-reason-decline}

Here are a few possible reasons why this is happening:

* Your card was issued in Russia / by a Russian bank
* Your card was issued in a nation affected by international sanctions / by a bank in such nation
* Your card has been involved in fraud previously
* The data your entered is invalid
* Our payment provided deemed your transaction as high-risk and has denied it
* Your card has been reported as stolen
* You card could not be verified using 3DS

Please [contact our staff](https://scnx.app/help) if you think none of these reasons apply.
