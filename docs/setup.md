# Get started on SCNX

Getting started on SCNX requires a quick setup, but you'll be able to create your own Discord-Bot right after that.

## 0. What is SCNX (not) {#step-0}

SCNX is **desinged for communities**. You can __**not create a public bot**__ on SCNX, instead you can create a bot for
*your* server that you can completely customize.

## 1. Log in to SCNX {#step-1}

:::info
To use SCNX, you agree to our [SCNX Terms of Service](https://sc-net.work/scnx-tos) and other legal documents. Please
make sure to read them before continuing :wink:
:::

Head over to [scnx.app](https://scnx.app) to get started. You'll be asked to login with your Discord-Account. To do
that, just click on the "Login with Discord" button. If you're wondering why we need access to certain data of you ("
scopes"), you can find the answere [in our FAQ](./scnx/account-and-billing/faq#discord-access).

## 2. Add the server to SCNX {#step-2}

Next, you'll see the [server overview page](https://scnx.app/user/guilds). Here you can see all servers you have access
to. Select the server you want to set up SCNX on.

:::tip Can't find your server?
Please make sure you are the **owner of a server** in order to add it to SCNX. If not, ask the owner to set up SCNX and
give you [Trusted Admin Permissions](scnx/guilds/trusted-admins). If you've recently created a server and it is not
visible in the dashboard, refresh the server list using the "Refresh data" button on the bottom of the page.
