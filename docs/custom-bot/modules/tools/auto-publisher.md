# Automatic Publishing

Publishes messages in announcement channels

<ModuleOverview moduleName="auto-publisher" />

## Features {#features}

* Automatically publish messages sent in announcement channels in your server.
* Whitelist or blacklist channels from automatic publishing.
* Ignore messages sent by bots (optional).

## Setup {#setup}

1. Make sure the bot has the "Manage messages" and "Send message" on all announcement channels the bot should follow.
2. [Configure](#configuration) the module.
3. Reload your configuration to apply changes.

## Usage {#usage}

Messages sent in eligible announcement channels (based on your [configuration](#configuration)) will be published to all
servers that follow your channel automatically.
When the module publishes a message, the bot will react with a `âœ…` as emoji to indicate publication success. This
reaction will be removed automatically after a few seconds.

## Configuration {#configuration}

Without any configuration, your bot will publish every message sent in announcement channels. Using the configuration,
you can fine-tune this behavior for your use-case.

## Troubleshooting {#troubleshooting}

If you believe the bot is not publishing messages automatically, please make sure that

* the current channel is added to the Whitelist field if "Message Publishing Mode" is set to `whitelist` in
  your [configuration](#configuration).
* the current channel is NOT added to the Blacklist field if "Message Publishing Mode" is set to `blacklist` in
  your [configuration](#configuration).
* the bot has "Send messages" and "Manage messages" permissions on the current channel.
* the message that you want published hasn't been sent by a bot (unless you have "Ignore bots?" disabled in
  your [configuration](#configuration)).
* the message was sent in an announcement channel and hasn't been published before.
* the number of messages sent in the announcement channel is relatively low (Discord only allows a limited number of
  messages to be published).
