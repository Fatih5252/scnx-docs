## Setup {#setup}

* To get started with pools, make sure that the bot has the following permissions on every channel you want to create
  polls in: Read messages, Send messages, Embed Links.
* Make sure that you have [set up permissions](./../../slash-commands) for [`/poll`](#commands) correctly.

## Usage {#usage}

Administrators can manage polls using the following commands:

* [`/poll create`](#commands) to create a new poll.
* [`/poll end`](#commands) to end a poll (polls end automatically if you have previously set a duration parameter
  on `/poll create`).

Users can

* vote on polls by using the select menu below the poll.
* view what they voted for using the "What have I voted?" button below the poll.
* remove they vote first using the "What have I voted?" button, then clicking on "Remove my vote" below the response.
* view (live) results in the poll embed.
* view which user voted for which option using the "View current voters" button below the poll (if the poll was set to
  public).

| `/polls create description:<Text> channel:<TextChannel> option1:<Text> option2:<Text> [option{n}:<Text>] [duration:<TimeDuration>] [public:<Boolean>]` | Create a new poll in the desired channel. Enter the the poll question as the `description` value and add possible options with the `option{n}` element. Optionally, make a poll public (meaning that anyone can view what users have voted for) using the `public` option - if enabled, a "View current voters" button will be added below the poll. To end a poll automatically, specify a `duration` in a [supported time duration value](./../../additional-features#durations). |
| `/polls end msg-id:<PollMessageID>`                                                                                                                    | Ends an already existing poll that hasn't ended yet instantly. The `msg-id` option will support auto complete, meaning that you can easily search for the poll description of the poll you want to end.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

## Troubleshooting {#troubleshooting}

If you are experiencing issues with the poll module please make sure that

* you haven't started a poll in an announcement channel (as messages can't be updated as frequently in such channels).
* your [message configuration](#configuration-strings) doesn't include any empty fields and that
  are [color values are valid](../../additional-features#embed-colors).
* your [configuration](#configuration-config) only includes valid emoji values (unicode for built-in emojis and full
  emoji IDs for custom emojis).
* the bot has the following permissions on the channel you want to start a poll in: Read messages, Send messages, Embed
  Links.

## Stored data {#data-usage}

The following data is being stored about every poll created via [commands](#commands):

* The ID of the poll message sent after creation
* The ID of the channel the poll was created in
* The question of the poll (`description` value in the command), including whether the poll is public or not
* The value of every voting option (`option{n}` values in the command)
* If enabled: Exact time at which the poll will expire (controlled by the `duration` option in the command) and whether
  the poll has ended
* View Metadata about your server (like name, icon, owner, â€¦)

Additionally, the following data will be stored about every user when they vote for an option:

* The ID of the user
* The number of the option they voted for

If the poll hasn't ended yet, users can [remove their vote](#usage). After a poll has ended, this option isn't available
anymore.

There is no way to remove polls from the database (you can always delete the poll regardless). To
remove all polls, [purge the module database](./../../additional-features#reset-module-database).
